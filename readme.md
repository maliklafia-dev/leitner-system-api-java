## 3.  Architecture and Design

The application follows **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** principles combined with a **Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)**.

- **Domain Layer**: Contains the business logic (`models`, `services`, `ports`).
- **Application Layer**: Coordinates interactions between the domain and infrastructure.
- **Infrastructure Layer**: Handles database operations, HTTP controllers, repositories, and external libraries.

This architecture allows:
- Better testability (domain is isolated and easy to unit test)
- Flexibility to replace adapters (e.g., change database without impacting business logic)
- Clear separation of concerns

## 4. Ô∏è Database Schema

The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) describes how entities interact in the database.

- A **Quizz** entity represents a quiz session taken by a user.
- A **Card** entity represents a question-answer flashcard.
- **Quizz_Cards** is a join table to associate multiple cards to a quiz.
- **Quizz_Answers** records if a card was answered correctly during a quiz.

This relational schema ensures data integrity and flexible querying.

## 5.  Test Coverage and CI/CD

###  Test Coverage
- The codebase is fully covered by **unit tests** and **integration tests**.
- **JaCoCo** is used to measure code coverage.
- Current coverage: **~80%**, ensuring strong code reliability.

After every commit or pull request, tests are automatically triggered and coverage is checked.

###  CI/CD Workflow
- **GitHub Actions** automates building, testing, and packaging.
- **CI** (Continuous Integration): Tests are executed automatically when code is pushed.
- **CD** (Continuous Deployment): Artifacts are built and ready for deployment.
- Deployments are managed through **Render**, a cloud service.
